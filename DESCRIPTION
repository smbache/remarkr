Description: Remarks act as simple pieces of information which are attached to
    objects, which may be of interest to "stakeholder" functionality. For example,
    there could be potential reasons for and problems associated with a limited data
    extract which is useful to pass on to functionality using or manipulating the
    data in subsequent routines.
